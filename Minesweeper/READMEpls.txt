I think you will need to import the project from the next folder in.
Basically there are three nested folders called Minesweeper, and I think the one in this current directory is the top level one.
But maybe not so just try it and see if it works.
Also you might have problems with line break characters because windows is dumb. If it asks you about anything, you want CRLF line breaks instead of LF.
